                <h4 className="mb-1">Why Choose Domain Leasing with VNOC?</h4>
                <br></br>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  <h5>1. Generate Ongoing Revenue:</h5> Leasing your domains opens the door to a consistent stream of revenue. Instead of a one-time sale, you can earn monthly income from lessees who are using your domain to build their online presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>2. Lower Entry Barrier:</h5> Leasing makes premium domains more accessible to startups, small businesses, and entrepreneurs who may not have the upfront capital for a full purchase. This widens your potential lessee pool and increases your leasing opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>3. Retain Ownership:</h5> Unlike traditional sales, leasing allows you to retain ownership of your domains while still profiting from them. This gives you the flexibility to explore different leasing arrangements and maximize your returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>4. Long-Term Potential:</h5> Some lessees may choose to eventually purchase the domain they're leasing. This creates a potential pathway to a full sale in the future, offering you the best of both worlds â€“ ongoing lease income and the possibility of a sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h5>5. Diversify Your Portfolio:</h5> Leasing your domains diversifies your revenue streams, reducing your reliance solely on sales. This strategic approach balances short-term profits with long-term income, making your domain portfolio more resilient.
